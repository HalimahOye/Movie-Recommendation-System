In todayâ€™s technology-driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical for ensuring that individuals can make appropriate choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. 
One application where this is especially true surrounds movie content recommendations; where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options.

This dataset consists of several million 5-star ratings obtained from users of the online MovieLens movie recommendation service. The MovieLens dataset has long been used by industry and academic researchers to improve the performance of explicitly-based recommender systems, and now you get to as well!

For this Predict, we'll be using a special version of the MovieLens dataset which has enriched with additional data, and resampled for fair evaluation purposes.

# Tools

Python packages: Pandas,Numpy

Scikit-Learn Surprise: SVDpp , SVD 

# Summary 

Root mean squared error (RMSE) was used as evaluation metrics

# Challenges
It was a heavy data set with a million plus records , dataset had to be reduced to for the model to easily handle it

It took a long time to run the algorithm when trying for the best hyperparameters
